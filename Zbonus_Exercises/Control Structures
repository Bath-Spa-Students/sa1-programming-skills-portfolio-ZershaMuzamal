#QUESTION
"""Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and
assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
•Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message
that the player just earned 5 points.
•Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The
version that fails will have no output.)"""
#ANSWER:
#FRIST VERSION = THE COLOR IS SAME SO IT WILL PASS THE TEST
#INITIALIZING THE VARIABLE 
aliens_color = "red"
#ADD THE IF STATEMENT AS PER THE REQUIRMENT
if aliens_color == "red":
    #PRINT STATEMENT IF THE CANDITION IS TRUE
   print("THE PLAYER HAS EARNED 5 POINTS")
#2ND VERSION = THE COLOR IS DIFFERENT SO IT WILL NOT PASS THE TEST
#INITIALIZING THE VARIABLE
aliens_color = "yellow"
#ADDING IF STATEMENT AS PER THE REQUIRMENT
if aliens_color == "red":
    #PRINT STATEMENT IF THE CONDITION IS TRUE 
   print("THE PLAYER HAS EARNED 5 POINTS")
