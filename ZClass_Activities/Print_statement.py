#PRACTICING PRINT STATEMENT OF MULTIPLE LINES
print("""All the classrooms I've been to are mostly very exciting and fun,
I think of all my classrooms as my home.
My mom raised me to be kind, and smart,
which is why I say my school is really really fun.
Some people think school is bad
but I think school is cool for kids.

I think most people are over exaggerating
and arguing the fact that school is bad.
School is my legacy most people are pure jealousy,
most kids are tired but I'm mostly focused on school.

Homework is fun and I also think of home as my school.
All these lines are making me think "I love school."
Writing, Reading, Math, Science, History, all of the above.
I have a wide grin to show my excitement.

Telling jokes makes me excited and it can show excitement.
School makes me happy I mostly jump because school rocks.
My dad makes me read books, and I'm having so much fun.

School rewards me to get a job, it teaches me excitement about the future.
Me and my family are the ones who will start me on my journey to college.

I would never forget all my studies that came to one purpose in life.
I would not forget the loved ones who used to help me.
I would not forget the teachers who taught me.
I would not forget all the progress that was made for my future in college.""")
