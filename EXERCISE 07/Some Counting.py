"""## Exercise 7: Some Counting - 20 Marks
Use your newly acquired knowledge of the for loop to complete the following tasks. Print all values to the console
in each case.
* Write a loop that counts up from 0 to 50 in increments of 1.
* Write a loop that counts down from 50 to 0 in decrements of 1.
* Write a loop that counts up from 30 to 50 in increments of 1.
* Write a loop that counts down from 50 to 10 in decrements of 2.
* Write a loop that counts up from 100 to 200 in increments of 5.
*You may include all loops in a single project*"""
