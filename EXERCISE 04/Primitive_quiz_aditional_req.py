## Exercise 4: Primitive Quiz - 30 Marks
"""In this exercise, you'll create a simple program that asks the user a question, evaluates their answer,
and provides feedback."""
### Steps:
"""1. Write a program that asks the user "What is the capital of France?" and waits for their response.
2. If the user's answer is correct (i.e., "Paris"), the program should print a message saying the answer
is correct.
3. If the answer is incorrect, the program should print a message saying the answer is wrong."""
###Advanced Requirements:
"""Ignore Capitalization: Modify your program to accept answers regardless of the capitalization
(e.g., "paris", "Paris", and "PaRis" 
should all be considered correct).
Multiple Questions: Extend the program into a quiz that asks for the capitals of 10 European countries.
 Provide feedback for each question."""
